In an era where data drives decisions, the ability to extract and harness information from online sources is invaluable. This project leverages the power of BeautifulSoup, a sophisticated web scraping tool, to delve into the dynamic world of Cars24. By navigating the site's intricate HTML framework, I have unearthed data on used cars in Mumbai region, including pricing, car models, fuel types, specifications and more. This project not only showcases web scraping techniques but also highlights the importance of data integrity and accuracy in digital information gathering.

# Project Overview:

Data Extraction: Using BeautifulSoup, I navigated the Cars24 website to scrape detailed information on used cars. The extraction process involved parsing the HTML structure to accurately capture essential data, including prices, models, buy links, car specs and fuel types etc. By targeting specific HTML elements and attributes, I was able to extract relevant information systematically, ensuring that each piece of data was correctly captured for all the listings. This raw data forms the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights into market trends and consumer preferences.

Data Insights: Although the primary focus was on data extraction, the project opened avenues for in-depth analysis, such as market trends in car pricing and consumer preferences for different fuel types. This data can provide valuable insights for both consumers and industry stakeholders, highlighting trends in the used car market.


#Skills and Tools: 
The project enhanced my skills in web scraping, utilizing Python and BeautifulSoup to effectively extract data. The experience highlighted the importance of meticulous data handling and demonstrated the potential of web scraping for gathering real-time market data.
